To experiment with the running times of the different threads, we ran the program 3 times for each network buffer size.

We have found that there is no significant different in running times, whether the buffer size is 10 or 20.
In other words, there is no correlation between running time and network buffer size.
This may be because a thread's speed of execution depends on the kernel system itself, rather than the code that is running.
Another reason may be that since threads are lightweight processes, they do not greatly impact a program's execution speed

3. Client Thread Running Time (Sending): 12 ms, 13ms, 20ms

4. Client Thread Running Time (Receiving): 18 ms, 13ms, 20ms

Network Buffer size 20
1. Network Thread Running Time: 72 ms, 82ms, 70ms

2. Server Thread Running Time is: 27 ms, 30ms, 30ms

3. Client Thread Running Time (Sending): 14 ms, 21ms, 10ms

4. Client Thread Running Time (Receiving): 16 ms, 21ms, 20ms
